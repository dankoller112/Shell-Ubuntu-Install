# Ubuntu post-installation script 
Post-installation script for my personal ubuntu system.  
Feel free to use it if you're in need for similiar programs. Tested and working on Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS. Should also work on other debian based systems. "Snap" package manager is recommended if you want to install all packages.
